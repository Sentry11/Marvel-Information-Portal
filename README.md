# Getting Started with Create React App

This application was developed based on the Marvel API.It is an information portal that has served me as a practice in learning React.<br/>

In this project, I adhered to all the requirements that, in my opinion, are assigned to the front-end developer.
Maintained modularity. Each component has its own stylesheet. In this project, all styles are written on the preprocessor ssss


During the development, hooks, libraries such as React Transition, React Helmet, Formic React Router were used. The app was slightly SEO optimized. Own developed hooks were applied and the principle of the finite state machine was introduced.
