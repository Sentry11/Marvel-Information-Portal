# Getting Started with Create React App

This application was developed based on the Marvel API.It is an information portal that has served me as a practice in learning React.<br/>

In this project, I adhered to all the requirements that, in my opinion, are assigned to the front-end developer.
Maintained modularity. Each component has its own stylesheet. In this project, all styles are written on the preprocessor scss.
Also, an additional task for this project was to work with a real API.

Moreover on this project, the principle of a finite automaton was implemented.<br/><br/>
## The project has the following functionality:
<li>Dynamic pagination;
<li>Brief biography of a random character in one click;
<li>List of downloadable comics;
<li>Character search service;
<li>Dynamic list for every comic book character they appear in;<br/>
<br/>The peculiarity of this project is just its modularity, each function or functionality is divided into folders.<br/> This simplifies the work with the project and makes it easy to read.<br/>

To run applications on your computer, first you need to install this repository on your PC.<br/>
Then install all dependencies with npm i command. Next, on the official website of the marvel api,
you need to register and get an api key. This is necessary if my key does not work for you.<br/>
Next, in the services directory in the MarvelServices file, you need to change the apiKey variable
